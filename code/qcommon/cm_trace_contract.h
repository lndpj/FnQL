/*
 * Observed: QLSRP's reconstructed `cm_trace.c` keeps the Quake III moving
 * capsule sweep unchanged, and its shared `surfaceflags.h` leaves 0x0400
 * unallocated.  The target capsule is reduced to a vertical cylinder capped
 * by two spheres, the target radius is expanded by the moving capsule radius,
 * and the cylinder section is only swept when it still has a positive height.
 *
 * Inferred: keeping that geometry in one shared helper lets the engine path
 * and the parity tests read the same numbers.  A source-shaped test alone
 * cannot tell a wrong capsule profile from a right one, so the behavioral
 * gate in `tests/collision_capsule_trace_tests.c` sweeps the real trace path.

 * Two different producers fill in `trace.plane`:
 *
 *  - Brush, patch and box hulls copy a stored BSP plane, so every fractional
 *    impact carries a unit normal.  This is the invariant worth enforcing.
 *  - The capsule sweep derives its plane analytically, scaling the radial
 *    vector at the impact point by 1/(radius + RADIUS_EPSILON).  That math is
 *    single precision, so the normal is only approximately unit: the
 *    quadratic loses significance as the sweep start moves away from the
 *    target.  Measured over 400k random player-vs-player capsule sweeps
 *    against a (-15,-15,-24)..(15,15,32) target, |normal|^2 stays inside 1e-4
 *    of one at movement scale, spreads to [0.79, 1.18] for 16k-unit sweeps,
 *    and reaches [0.22, 4.75] at the 64k world limit.  A zero-fraction
 *    analytic contact may also carry no plane at all, or a deliberately
 *    sub-unit radial plane from inside the one-unit collision epsilon.
 *
 * The debug invariant therefore demands a unit plane only where the engine
 * actually produces one, while still catching corrupt fractions, non-finite
 * values, and degenerate normals on every path.
